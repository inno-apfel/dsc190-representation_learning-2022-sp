<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started in DSC 190, you'll need to set up accounts on a
couple of websites.</p>
<h3 id="campuswire">Campuswire</h3>
<p>We'll be using <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/G4DF8DFD1/feed">Campuswire</a> as our course message
board. You should have received an invitation via email, but if not you should
be able to join by clicking the link above and using the access code <code>0734</code>. Be sure sure to join Campuswire as soon as possible,
since all course communication will be done through it.</p>
<p>If you have a question about anything to do with the course  &mdash; if you're
stuck on a homework problem, want clarification on the logistics, or just have a
general question about data science &mdash; you can make a post on Campuswire.
We only ask that if your question includes some or all of an answer, please make
your post <strong>private</strong> so that others cannot see it. You can also post
anonymously if you would prefer.</p>
<p>Course staff will regularly check Campuswire and try to answer any questions
that you have. You're also encouraged to answer a question asked by another
student if you feel that you know the answer.</p>
<h3 id="gradescope">Gradescope</h3>
<p>We'll be using 
<a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/633453">Gradescope</a> for
homework submission and grading. Most of the assignments will be a mixture of math and
coding, and the coding parts are usually autograded via Gradescope.,
You should have received an email invitation for Gradescope, but if not you can join with code
<code>XX2JJN</code>.</p>
<h3 id="canvas">Canvas</h3>
<p>We will not be using Canvas. All course materials will be available at
<a href="http://dsc190.com">dsc190.com</a> or <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/633453">Gradescope</a>.</p>
<h3 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h3>
<p>You will not need to purchase any materials for this course; we'll use lecture slides the main
resource, as well as our own <a href="./materials/default/notes/book.pdf">course notes</a>.
If you'd like additional textbooks to study from, we can recommend these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani; <em>Algorithms</em></li>
<li>Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein; <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These books are also <em>excellent</em> resources for interview preparation.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>
<p>Lectures will be held in-person at the regularly-scheduled time and place, but
they will be podcasted and posted online for remote viewing. Attendance is
appreciated, but not required.</p>
<p>Since there are two sections of the course, there will be two different lecture
times, but they will cover the same content on the same schedule. The lecture times are:
5:00 PM
on
T/Th
in
WLH 2204.</p>
<p>You may attend whichever lecture section you would like after Week 02.</p>
<p>You will be able to find the lecture recordings at <a href="https://podcast.ucsd.edu/">podcast.ucsd.edu</a>.</p>
<h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h2>
<p>Course staff, including tutors, TAs, and instructors, will hold office hours
regularly throughout the week. Please see the <a href="./office_hours.html">office
hours</a> page for the schedule and for instructions.</p>
<h2 id="discussions">Discussions</h2>
<p>Since there are two sections of the course, there are two discussion times, but they
will cover the same content on the same schedule.</p>
<p>The discussion times are:
5:00 PM
on
Friday
in
MOS 204.</p>
<p>The discussions review the materials from that week's lectures and
prepare you for the homework. Just as with lecture, topics and techniques introduced
in discussion might appear on the homework and in exams. In particular, some of the more
difficult homework problems may be partially solved in discussion section to give you a
good start.</p>
<p>Discussions will also serve as midterm reviews in the weeks leading up to the exams.</p>
<p>Attendance is recommended, but not required. The discussions will be podcasted,
but the nature of discussion section (they usually involve a large amount of
groupwork) means that the podcasted discussion might not be as useful as
in-person attendance.</p>
<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>
<p>There will be two types of assignments in DSC 190: <em>labs</em> and <em>homeworks</em>.
Labs help develop <em>essential</em> knowledge, while homeworks test your ability to
apply that knowledge to solve more difficult problems. You can think of labs as
a quick check on your understanding before you head into the homework.</p>
<p>Labs consist of a small number of autograded multiple choice or numerical answer
questions. They will be posted on Gradescope weekly. The exams will mostly
consist of questions of a similar format and difficulty as those on the labs.
However, the exams will have a time limit, while the labs have no time limit.</p>
<p>In previous iterations of DSC 190, these "essential" questions were actually a
part of the homeworks. We have decided to move these essential problems to their
own lab assignment, therefore making the homeworks shorter. This has a big
benefit: because the labs are autograded and due before the homeworks, you'll
get your lab grade <em>before</em> heading into the homework. This gives you an
opportunity to patch up any misunderstandings.</p>
<h3 id="lab-grading">Lab Grading</h3>
<p>You should think of the labs as a first practice towards the goal of mastering
the topics in DSC 190. But the first time you practice anything, you're not going
to be perfect. The key is to <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044022"><em>learn from the
mistakes</em></a>.</p>
<p>In other classes, like DSC 40B, I encourage this with the concept of <em>lab
redemption</em>, where you can re-earn lost credit by discussing your
misconceptions with a tutor or TA. However, we only have one TA for this class,
and they will be too busy with homework grading and discussions to process
hundreds of redemption request per week. This means that the usual lab
redemption policy isn't feasible.</p>
<p>Instead of redemption, we'll use a grading formula that is forgiving of
mistakes to determine your lab score at the end of the quarter:</p>
<p><center>
overall lab score = (lab points earned during the quarter) / (80% of lab points available during the quarter)
</center></p>
<p>In other words, in order to get a score of 100% on the lab component of the class, you need to get
only 80% of the lab questions right throughout the quarter.
Note that the overall lab score will be capped at 100%, so the actual formula is:</p>
<p><center>
overall lab score = min { (lab points earned during the quarter) / (80% of lab points available during the quarter), 1 }
</center></p>
<p>This has a similar effect to the usual lab redemption policy in that it is
forgiving of mistakes, but it also means that you won't be talking to a TA
about your misconceptions (which is meant to be a tool for learning). You're
encouraged to review each week's lab and think critically about why you missed
the questions you got wrong. Remember: the exams will have questions that are
very similar in nature to the labs.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks">Homeworks</h2>
<p>There will be eight homeworks assigned throughout the quarter, plus one <a href="#the-super-homework">"super homework"</a>
(described below).
Homeworks will be a mixture of written problems (which are manually graded by our tutor
staff) and coding problems (which are autograded).
Each homework will be due via
Gradescope at 11:59 PM on the 
Monday 
after it
is assigned except otherwise noted, and you'll have roughly a week to complete
each assignment from the time it is posted.</p>
<p>The homework due date is carefully chosen to fit within a one week "cycle".
A "week" in DSC 190
will start with Tuesday's lecture, followed by Thursday's. That
week's discussion on Friday will review the
lecture topics with an eye towards practical application. The lab is then due
on Thursday, giving you some practice
before the homework. The homework is then due on the next Monday, giving you some
time after the discussion and lab to complete it.</p>
<p>The lowest homework score is dropped. If a homework is dropped, all parts of it
(programming problems, etc.) are removed from the calculation for your homework
score. The homework that is dropped is chosen to maximize your overall homework
score. The Super Homework cannot be dropped.</p>
<h3 id="regrade-requests">Regrade Requests</h3>
<p>If you feel that the grader has made a mistake, you may submit a regrade request
via Gradescope within <em>one week</em> of the grades being released. Note that part
of your grade is clarity, so if your answer was mostly right but unclear you may
still not receive full credit.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>regrade</strong> requests are not the same thing as <strong>redemption</strong> requests (though both are
submitted on Gradescope in the same way). Unfortunately, we cannot offer
redemption requests for homework problems as we do with lab problems ‚Äî homework
problems are typically more complex and require more time to grade, and
regrading them would take more resources than we have available.</p>
<h3 id="catastrophic-regrades">Catastrophic regrades</h3>
<p>If your code causes the autograder to fail because of a missing import, typo,
or other small error, you can ask the TA for a <strong>catastrophic regrade</strong>. You
should provide the TA with fixed code (limited to changing, adding, or removing
four or fewer lines of code) to submit on your behalf. Catastrophic regrades are
not intended for fixing <em>logical</em> errors in your code, even if they're small.</p>
<p>Performing catastrophic regrades is time-intensive for us, and we can't afford
to do many of them. Therefore, we limit you to requesting a maximum of <strong>two
catastrophic regrades</strong> per quarter. Please submit your catastrophic regrades within one week of the grades being released.</p>
<p>Unlike in real life, catastrophes are avoidable in DSC 190 by paying close
attention to the autograder's output after submitting your code -- it will tell
you if your file was named incorrectly, your imports do not exist, etc.</p>
<h3 id="the-super-homework">The "Super Homework"</h3>
<p>Instead of a comprehensive final exam, we'll have a comprehensive "Super
Homework". The super homework will focus on the content from the last two weeks
of the quarter, but it will also contain material from throughout DSC 190. It
will be about twice as long as a typical homework.</p>
<p>Because the super homework covers twice as much material as a usual homework, it
will be worth roughly twice as much. However, you may still collaborate on the super
homework as long as you write up solutions in your own words.</p>
<p>The super homework will be due during finals week (the exact date is yet to be determined).</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-and-ai">Collaboration and AI</h2>
<p>You are highly encouraged to <em>think</em> about the lab and homework problems
together, but you must turn in your own solutions written in your own words. We
feel that discussing homework problems is an excellent way to learn, but writing
the solutions in your own words promotes a deeper, more solid understanding than
discussion alone.</p>
<p>We recommend the following way of working on the labs and homeworks. First, meet
with your partner to discuss the solutions, but don't leave the meeting with
anything written down. Wait an hour or so, then write up the solutions in your
own words working from memory. In that hour, you inevitably forgot some of the
details of the solution. If you find that you have trouble filling them in, its
a sign that you might not have understood the solution as well as you first
thought!</p>
<p>You're also encouraged to use AI (ChatGPT, etc.) in a similar way: you can talk
to ChatGPT about a problem, but don't copy its answer verbatim. Instead, wait
about an hour and put the answer in your own words. Keep in mind that ChatGPT
is infamous for being very confidently wrong, so be critical of its output.
Also keep in mind that you won't have ChatGPT on the exams, so you'll need to
understand the fundamental concepts for yourself in order to do well.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or worries about whether your collaboration
constitutes
a violation of academic integrity, feel free to ask us on Campuswire.</p>
<h2 id="slip-days">Slip Days</h2>
<p>You have <strong><em>five</em></strong> <strong>slip days</strong> to use throughout the quarter on any lab or homework
(including the super homework). A slip day extends the deadline by 24 hours.
Slip days cannot be "stacked" or "combined" to extend the deadline further
&mdash; the latest any assignment can be submitted is 24 hours after the
deadline. Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, but
it's your responsibility to keep track of how many you have left.</p>
<p>Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency in
deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an assignment
on its original due date (or if you forgot about it). But slips days are also
meant for things like the internet going down at 11:58 PM just as you go to
submit your homework. Slip days are to be used in exceptional circumstances, so
you probably shouldn't get close to using all of them ‚Äî if you do get close to
using that many, we will likely reach out to make sure that everything is OK.</p>
<p>Note that slip days are not designed to help in the case of a serious illness or
other unfortunate event that severely disrupts your ability to participate in
the class. If something like that should arise, please let us know ASAP!</p>
<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>
<h3 id="midterms">Midterms</h3>
<p>There will be two midterm exams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Midterm 01</strong>: Tuesday, October 31 (focuses on Lectures 01 &mdash; 08)</li>
<li><strong>Midterm 02</strong>: Thursday, November 30 (focuses on Lectures 09 &mdash; 15)</li>
</ul>
<p>The exams will be held in-person during the regularly-scheduled lecture times.</p>
<h3 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h3>
<p>The final exam for DSC 190 is a "no fault" final split into two sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>An optional Midterm 01 "Redemption" section focusing on Lectures 01 &mdash; 08</li>
<li>An optional Midterm 02 "Redemption" section focusing on Lectures 09 &mdash; 15</li>
</ol>
<p>If your score on the midterm redemption section is higher than your score on the
original midterm, it will replace that grade. Getting a lower score on a
redemption section cannot hurt you (but it will make us sad). As a consequence,
the redemption sections are effectively optional.</p>
<p>Under this policy, a bad performance on an earlier exam can be erased by good
performance on the same material in a later exam.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You got an "F" on Midterm 1 and a "B" on Midterm 2. You decide to take only the
first redemption section on the final (though you could have taken both), and you
receive an "A". Your midterm scores are now "A" and "B".</p>
<p>The redemption exams will be held on the date scheduled by the registrar: Friday, December 15.</p>
<p>Note that the topics from Lectures 16, 17, and 18 are not on any exam. These will
instead be tested in the <a href="#the-super-homework">Super Homework</a>.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>We'll be using the following grading scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>12.5%: Labs (see <a href="#lab-grading">Lab Grading</a> above)</li>
<li>30%: Homeworks (lowest dropped)</li>
<li>7.5%: "Super Homework"</li>
<li>25%: Midterm 01 (or Redemption Midterm 01, whichever is larger)</li>
<li>25%: Midterm 02 (or Redemption Midterm 02, whichever is larger)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a typical quarter, the midterm redemption policy has the same effect as a
traditional "curve", therefore replacing the need for one.  The standard grading
scale (where an A is 93+, A- is 90+, B+ is 87+, etc.) will be used as a starting
point, but once all scores are in, we will run a clustering algorithm to
automatically find the best cutoffs for each letter grade. These cutoffs can
only be lowered. For instance, the threshold for an "A" will never be higher
than 93%.</p>
<p>A+ grades are not awarded according to a threshold. Instead, A+'s are awarded
to the top 5% of students by overall grade.</p>
<h2 id="support-and-resources">Support and Resources</h2>
<p>As instructors, our job is to foster an environment where everyone, regardless
of identity, feels welcome and is able to focus on learning. If there is

<p>More generally, if you have <em>any</em> concerns about your ability to focus or
succeed in this course, or just need someone to talk to, <em>please</em> contact
us ASAP and we'll figure something out.</p>
<h2 id="osd-exam-accommodations">OSD Exam Accommodations</h2>
<p>If you have exam accommodations from the OSD, you should receive an email from
the data science program that will ask you to provide your availability for
your accommodated exam. The program will then schedule the exam and notify the
instructor of its time and location. If you do not receive such an email by the
end of the second week of classes, please let us know!</p>
<p>Please be sure to respond to the email from the data science program; if the
program does not hear back from you, they will be unable to schedule your
accommodated exam.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="is-this-class-curved">Is this class curved?</h3>
<p>In a typical quarter, the midterm redemption policy has the same effect as a
traditional "curve", therefore replacing the need for one.  The standard grading
scale (where an A is 93+, A- is 90+, B+ is 87+, etc.) will be used as a starting
point, but once all scores are in, we will run a clustering algorithm to
automatically find the best cutoffs for each letter grade. These cutoffs can
only be lowered. For instance, the threshold for an "A" will never be higher
than 93%.</p>
